Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood Rules

1. Numbers containing a 1 replace all digits with the string "Beep!"
 ie. 109 becomes "Beep!"

 2. numbers containing a 2 all digits are replaced with the string "Boop!"
 ie. 2099 becomes "Boop!"

 3. numbers that contain 3 all digits are replaced with the string "Won't you be my neighbor?"
 ie 305 becomes "Won't you be my neighbor?"

4.  if a number contains the number above it replace with the higher string ie 32 becomes "Won't you be my Neighbor?"
